# pocket-PLA
Implementation of Machine Learning algorithm (pocket perceptron learning algorithm) without sci-kit learn.

It creates a random linear target function and generates 100 random points. After that, the pocket perceptron algorithm starts to learn and in the end the visualization of classified points, the target function (f) and the generated function (g) is presented using matplotlib library.
